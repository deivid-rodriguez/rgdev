# Rgdev

A Ruby gem to simplify contributing to [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems),
by using a Docker-based development environment.

## Dependencies

1. Docker
2. Git
3. Ruby

## Usage

This is a gem meant to make developing RubyGems itself easier, and as such
doesn't make much sense if you're not contributing to RubyGems.

### First-time setup

    $ git clone https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.git
    $ cd rubygems
    $ gem install rgdev # Install the rgdev gem.
    $ rgdev rake setup  # Install RubyGems development dependencies.

### Execute commands in the Docker container

Now, with setup done, you're ready to execute commands inside the Docker container:

    $ rgdev <command to run in the Docker container>

**Example**: Running the RubyGems test suite inside the Docker container

    $ rgdev rake test

### Removing docker volumes

If you want to remove the docker volume associated with using rgdev in a
particular directory, you can run these commands:

    $ cd /path/to/directory
    $ rgdev --reset

In order to use rgdev in that directory again, you'll need to do `rgdev
rake setup` again.

## Developing Rgdev

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `rgdev.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
